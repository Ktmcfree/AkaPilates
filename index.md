# Bio
Creating an environment where everyBody can move, condition, release and make a physical home for the constant shifts.

Katie has had an evolving twenty four year career as a movement and Pilates teacher and is certified through NPCP. She came to Pilates as a professional dancer in Philadelphia and continued her training here in Rhode Island with Jen McWalter, Cheryl Turnquist and many others. During the pandemic she was able to deepen her knowledge taking live dissection workshops with Tom Myers (Anatomy Trains). Her dance background has highly informed her Pilates teaching, particularly within ideas of anatomic imagery, rhythm, breath, direction, balance and the joy of movement. In the fall Katie will start a certification process through the Franklin Method which teaches science based methods of movement. Katie also teaches yoga and dance technique and has taught dance composition and theory. She holds a BA in Dance and Anthropology from Connecticut College and an MFA in Dance Performance from University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.

# Experience
I offer a guided mindful movement workout with emphasis on heightened sensitivity, functional conditioning thereby imagination is a key component. Joseph Pilates and those that carried his teachings worked with spring tension, rhythm-breath, physical function etc. and my practice has been wholly influenced by this legacy and i am deeply grateful for his and all those who have taught the form. I work with Balanced Body equipment and use a variety of props for deepening in specific areas of integrated core connection. While it is a Pilates based workout there is an emphasis on efficiency and autonomy.
